usfm_rev2:

Added \toc3 marker to each book
Changed \toc3 references MAT to MOT, MRK to MAK
Removed from Luk 10:35 \r LUK 10: 36 126

usfm_rev3:

Started with usfm_rev2. Imported/exported through Bibledit to remove \v error.
Namely, \v should start on its own line, otherwise Scripture App Builder is unhappy.

usfm_rev4:

Typo Space Issues:  Luke 21 link to Mak 12: 41- 44 Need to take out space after : and John 12:20 title with 3 references all with space typo issues.  Could you run a program to detect all occurrences where there is a space in a reference?  Format that works for example is Mot 24:1-35 with a space after the book name only.  Where there are spaces after the colon (:) or after the dash (-), the links do not work. Fixed at Bugathon in rev4 on 6/8/19

Still to be corrected (need translator input):
John  Introduction – References in 3rd paragraph in general and specific to bhag 13-17 and bhag 20-21.  Perhaps OT references?  5/11/19 - Aha MOMENT!  May be referring to the word “Chapter” like the note left for Darlong. Will need translator input to fix this issue without creating other issues.
